# windows-display-void-output
**What is this**  
You might get a laptop device whatever what it is.  
And you found that when you close the monitor(or Win+L lock screen),  
the entire system almost sleeps immediately...  

And your torrent client does not work, too.  
Desktop applications not work but Windows Store Apps is fine,  
but useless for you.  

You still want a close monitor to reduce battery usage.  
And you want the thing close monitor and keep working for your long time task.  

This script use void display to keep Windows runningï¼Œ  
but output nothing video signal so hardware will think you still using it.  
Also, change some powerplan to prevent auto sleep.  

**How to use**  
Run the script, the screen should go black.  
When you want to re-open the monitor, press Win+P twice,  
or more time until it actually switches back.  

**Security warns:**  
**NOTE: Screen lock need to be disabled so anyone can access your device when who can touch it!**  
**Run a virtual machine may be help but most laptop doesn't have the performace for a virtual machine.**  

**Special thanks**
